"""This module contains the code for the FERRETModel Fitting application. 
It defines the GUI and the logic providing the application's functionality. 
The GUI was built using PyQT5.

How to Use.
-----------
   The FERRET-Model-Fitting application allows the user to analyse 
   organ time/concentration data by fitting a model to the 
   Region Of Interest (ROI) time/concentration curve. 
   The FERRET-Model-Fitting application provides the following functionality:
        1. Load an XML configuration file that describes the models to be fitted
            to the concentration/time data.
        2. Then load a CSV file of concentration/time or MR Signal/time data.  
            The first column must contain time data in seconds. 
            remaining columns of data must contain concentration in 
			millimoles (mM) or MR signal data for individual organs 
            at the time points in the time column. 
			There must be at least 2 columns of concentration data.  
			There is no upper limit on the number of columns of concentration data.
			Each time a CSV file is loaded, the screen is reset to its initial state.
        3. Select a Region Of Interest (ROI) and display a plot of its concentration against
            time.
        4. The user can then select a model they would like to fit to the ROI data.  
            When a model is selected, a schematic representation of it may be
           displayed on the right-hand side of the screen if an image is available.
           An image file will have to be stored in the images 
           folder in the root folder containing the application 
           source code and its name defined in the XML configuration file.
        5. Depending on the model selected the user can then select an Arterial Input Function(AIF)
            and/or a Venous Input Function (VIF) and display a plot(s) of its/their concentration 
            against time on the same axes as the ROI.
        6. After step 4 is performed, the selected model is used 
           to create a time/concentration series
           based on default values for the models input parameters.  
          data series is also plotted on the above axes.
        7. The default model parameters are displayed on the form 
           and the user may vary them and observe the effect on 
           the curve generated in step 5.
        8. Clicking the 'Reset' button resets the model 
           input parameters to their default values.
        9. By clicking the 'Fit Model' button, the model is 
           fitted to the ROI data and the resulting values 
           of the model input parameters are displayed on 
           the screen together with their 95% confidence limits.
        10. By clicking the 'Save plot data to CSV file' button the data plotted on the screen is saved
            to a CSV file - one column for each plot and a column for time.
            A file dialog box is displayed allowing the user to select a location 
            and enter a file name.
        11. By clicking the 'Save Report in PDF Format', 
            current state of the model fitting session
            is saved in PDF format.  This includes a image 
            of the plot, name of the model, name of the 
            data file and the values of the model input parameters. 
            If curve fitting has been carried 
            out and the values of the model input parameters 
            have not been manually adjusted, then the report 
            will contain the 95% confidence limits of the 
            model input parameter values arrived at by curve fitting.
        12. While this application is running, events & function 
            calls with data where appropriate 
            are logged to a file called FERRET.log, 
            stored at the same location as the 
            source code or executable. This file can be used as a debugging aid. 
            When a new instance of the application is started, 
            FERRET.log from the last session will be deleted
            and a new log file started.
        13. Clicking the 'Start Batch Processing' button applies model fitting
            to the MR signal/time data in all the files in the folder containing
            the data file selected in step 2.  For each file, a PDF report is created
            as in step 11. Also, a Microsoft Excel spread sheet summarising all
            the results is generated.
        14. Clicking the 'Exit' button closes the application.

Application Module Structure.
---------------------------
The code in FERRET.py defines the GUI and the logic providing 
the application's functionality.  The GUI was built using PyQT5.

The FerretXMLReader.py class module uses the xml.etree.ElementTree package to parse
the XML configuration file that describes all the models to be made available
for curve fitting.  It also contains functions that query the XML tree using
XPath notation and return data.

The styleSheet.py module contains style instructions using CSS 
notation for each control/widget.

The MathsTools.py module contains a library of mathematical functions 
used to solve the equations in the models in ModelFunctionsHelper.py.

Objects of the following 2 classes are created in modelFittingGUI.py 
and provide services to this class:
    1. The PDFWrite.py class module creates and saves a report 
    of a model fitting session in a PDF file.
    2. The ExcelWriter.py class module uses the openpyxl package 
    to create an Excel spreadsheet and write a summary of the 
    results from the batch processing of data files.

The ModelFunctions.py class module contains functions that use 
tracer kinetic models to calculate the variation of concentration
with time according to several tracer kinetic models. 

The ModelFunctionsHelper module coordinates the calling of model 
functions in ModelFunctions.py by functions in ModelFittingGUI.py

GUI Structure
--------------
The GUI is based on the QWidget class.
The GUI contains a single form.  Controls are arranged in two 
vertical columns on this form using Vertical Layout widgets.
Consequently, a horizontal layout control in placed on this form. 
Within this horizontal layout are placed 2 vertical layout controls.

The left-hand side vertical layout holds controls pertaining to the input and 
selection of data and the selection of a model to analyse the data. The results
of curve fitting, optimum parameter values and their confidence limits
are displayed next to their parameter input values.

The right-hand side vertical layout holds controls for the display of a schematic 
representation of the chosen model and a canvas widget for the 
graphical display of the data.

The appearance of the GUI is controlled by the CSS commands in styleSheet.py

Reading Data into the Application.
----------------------------------
The function LoadModelLibrary loads and parses the contents of the 
XML file that describes the models to be used for curve fitting.  
If parsing is successful, the XML tree is stored in memory 
and used to build a list of models for display in a combo box on the GUI,
and the 'Load Data File' button is made visible.
See the README file for a detailed description of the XML configuration file.

Clicking the 'Load Data File' button executes the LoadDataFile function.
The function LoadDataFile loads the contents of a CSV file
containing time and MR signal data into a dictionary of lists.
The key is the name of the organ or 'time' and the 
corresponding value is a list of MR signals for that organ
(or times when the key is 'time').  
The header label of each column of data is taken as a key.  
        
The following validation is applied to the data file:
    -The CSV file must contain at least 3 columns of data separated by commas.
    -The first column in the CSV file must contain time data.
    -The header of the time column must contain the word 'time'.

A list of keys is created and displayed in drop down lists to provide a means 
of selecting the Region of Interest (ROI), Arterial Input Function (AIF) and
the Venous Input Function (VIF).

As the time data is read, it is divided by 60 in order to convert it into minutes.

        Upto 5 model input parameters can be displayed on the GUI.

        a checkbox to indicate if this parameter should have its

        the upper and lower 95% confidence limits of the parameter value

        curve fitting.

        When a model is selected, this function is called.  
        Each model may have upto 5 parameters.  Parameter labels,
        parameter spinboxes and fix parameter checkboxes already exist
        on the form but are hidden. The naming convention of these
        widgets follows a fixed pattern. For the parameter label, this
        is 'labelParameter' followed by a suffix 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
        For the parameter spinbox, this is 'spinBoxParameter' 
        followed by a suffix 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  For the checkbox
        that indicates if a parameter should be constrainted during
        curve fitting this is 'ckbParameter' followed by a 
        suffix 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

        spinbox and checkbox for a given parameter according to the
        data in the xml configuration file.
