# Dummy models

**Note:** This is a library of dummy models to illustrate code structure and how MDR is meant to be used. 
Some models themselves are not physically accurate and should not be used for image analysis.
Users are expected to implement their own signal model fits for corresponding MR datasets to use as part of the MDR_Library. 
The supplied models have been tested only on the MR data provided with this library and should only be used as a reference to understand how to apply your own signal model fit to the MDR_Library.

The following models (found in the 'models' folder) have been implemented for the purpose of testing the MDR_Library on the MRI dataset acquired (and supplied with this library) as part of the iBEAt study.

The 'tests' folder within the MDR_Library consists of corresponding python test scripts for each of these models.

# How to implement your own model into the MDR_Library:

Your python script for the model definition is expected to contain the following main function (see below).

`def main(images_to_be_fitted, signal_model_parameters):`

where,  
*images_to_be_fitted (numpy.ndarray)* is the input image at different time-series with shape [x-dim\*y-dim, total time-series].    
and    
*signal_model_parameters (list)* is a list containing independent model-fit parameters as the list elements.   

With the following 2 return parameters for the main function:

*fit (numpy.ndarray):* is the signal model fit at all time-series with shape [x-dim\*y-dim, total time-series].   
and     
*fitted_parameters (numpy.ndarray)* are the output signal model fit parameters stored in a single nd-array with shape [2, x-dim\*y-dim].
